# Matchismo
## A CS193 project
### by James Dunn

This is a card matching memory game for the iPhone. It is the first project
in my CS193P class on iOS programming in Objective-C.

I'm making this game by following along with the lecture videos and slides,
as well as completing the homework assignments.

While I'm not getting credit for this course, I am learning a great deal for free.
You can too, by visiting the [iTunes University page][1] for this course.

I should note, that my only motivation for plugging this link, is my gratitude to
Stanford University, and Professor Paul Hegarty, for making this material free to all.
I sincerely hope it helps other aspiring app developers.


Cheers,
James Dunn
